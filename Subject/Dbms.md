Database Management System (DBMS) Notes
1. Introduction to Data
Definition: Data is any fact that can be stored.

Key Concept: When processed, data becomes information.

2. What is a Database?
A database is a structured collection of interrelated data, organized to enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information.
Key Characteristics

Collection of interrelated data.
Stored in the form of tables.
Can vary in size (small to large).

3. What is a File System?
A file system is a structure used by an operating system to manage and organize files on a storage device (e.g., hard drive, USB flash drive). It defines how data is organized, accessed, and stored, acting as an interface between the user and the data.
Disadvantages of File Systems

Data Redundancy: Duplication occurs when the same data (e.g., customer details) is stored in multiple files, such as separate spreadsheets for sales, contacts, and inventory.
Poor Memory Utilization: Storing duplicate data wastes memory resources.
Data Inconsistency: Inconsistent updates (e.g., updating a customer’s address in one file but not others) cause discrepancies.
Data Security: Lack of controlled access mechanisms, unlike DBMS, which restricts access to sensitive data.

4. Database Management System (DBMS)
A DBMS is software designed to manage, manipulate, and organize large volumes of data efficiently. It serves as an interface between the database and users or applications, providing tools for storing, retrieving, updating, and managing data securely.
Examples

Banking Systems
Airline Reservation Systems
Education Management Systems

Need for DBMS

Data Management: Supports insert, delete, update, and search operations.
Data Accuracy and Security: Prevents unauthorized access.
Decision-Making Support: Facilitates data-driven decisions.

Advantages of DBMS

Data Security: Protects against unauthorized access.
Reduced Redundancy and Inconsistency: Eliminates duplicate data, minimizing storage needs and ensuring consistency.Example: Storing the same data in multiple registers wastes memory and slows updates.
Data Integrity: Enforces rules and constraints to prevent incorrect data entry.Example: Ensures age is entered as an integer.
Data Scalability: Handles large datasets and scales seamlessly.Example: Adding 1200 new employee records to a database with 40 employees.
Data Abstraction: Allows users to interact with the database without understanding its underlying complexities.

Disadvantages of DBMS

High Cost: Expensive to implement and maintain.
Not Ideal for Small Projects: Overly complex for small-scale applications.
Vendor Lock-in: Switching between DBMS types (e.g., SQL to NoSQL) is challenging.

5. Data Abstraction
Data abstraction simplifies database interaction by hiding complex structures, allowing users to work with the database without understanding its underlying details.
Example: Users don’t need to know about indexing, memory storage, or data structures to query the database.
Levels of Abstraction

Physical Level: Describes how data is stored, including complex data structures.
Logical Level: Defines what data is stored and its structure (middle level).
View Level: The highest level, focusing on user interaction and accessible data.

6. What is a Schema?
A schema is a logical container that defines the structure of a database, acting as a blueprint for data organization.
Key Functions

Defines how data is organized.
Specifies data types and constraints.
Establishes relationships between data.
Ensures data integrity, consistency, and efficient retrieval.

Types of Schema

Physical Schema

Defines how data is stored on hardware (e.g., storage format, file organization, indexing).
Characteristics: Focuses on optimizing storage and retrieval.Example: Using clustered indexing for faster data retrieval.


Logical Schema

Defines the structure of data in tables, relationships, and constraints, independent of hardware.



Types of Logical Schema

Conceptual Schema: Represents the overall database structure and relationships.Example: A university database with entities like Student (StudentID, Name, Address), Course (CourseID, CourseName), and Department (DepartmentID, DepartmentName), with relationships such as students enrolling in multiple courses.
External/View Schema: Defines user-specific views of the database.Example: A student portal view showing StudentProfile (StudentID, Name, Address, CoursesEnrolled) without access to other students’ data or course details.

Characteristics of Logical Schema

Defines tables, primary/foreign keys, and views.
Prioritizes data modeling over hardware/storage specifics.

7. What is an Instance?
An instance is the information stored in a database at a specific point in time.
8. 3-Tier DBMS Architecture
The 3-tier architecture separates the database system into three layers for modularity and scalability.

Presentation Layer: Handles the user interface.
Application Layer: Manages business logic.
Data Layer: Manages data storage and processing.

Advantages of 3-Tier Architecture

Scalability: Each layer can be adjusted independently.
Security: Clients don’t directly access the server.
Modularity and Maintainability: Separated responsibilities simplify maintenance.
Performance: Individual optimization of layers improves performance.

Disadvantages of 3-Tier Architecture

Increased Complexity: Additional middle layer doubles communication points.
Potential Latency/Bottlenecks: Issues in any layer can cause delays.
Longer Development Time: Distributed responsibilities increase development time.
Resource Overhead: Extra tier requires more resources for development and maintenance.

9. Data Models
Data models define relationships between database components, providing a framework for data organization.
Types of Data Models

Hierarchical Data Model
Organizes data in a tree structure with parent-child relationships.
Primarily used in older database systems.


Network Data Model
Allows multiple parent-child relationships, resembling a graph.
More flexible than the hierarchical model.


Relational Data Model
Organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns.
Most common model, using SQL for manipulation.


Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model)
Represents entities and their relationships visually.


Object-Oriented Data Model
Integrates object-oriented programming concepts into databases.



NoSQL Data Models

Document-Oriented: e.g., MongoDB
Key-Value: e.g., Redis
Column-Family: e.g., Cassandra
Graph: e.g., Neo4j

10. Entity and Its Types
An entity represents a real-world object or concept stored in the database.
Types of Entities

Strong Entity
Has a unique identifier (primary key) and exists independently.
Example: A Person entity with attributes like PersonID, Name.


Weak Entity
Lacks its own primary key and depends on a strong entity (owner) for its identity.
Example: A Dependents entity linked to an Employee entity, where dependents rely on the employee’s ID.
